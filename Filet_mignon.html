    <h2>Steps to perfection</h2>
            <ol><h6>
                <li>Start by removing your filet mignons from the refridgerator 30-60 minutes before expected cook time. This allows the meat to reach an even temparature all the way through.</li>
                <li>You are now ready to begin pre-heating your oven to 350F.</li>
                <li>Place your cast-iron skillet on the stove on medium-high heat with 2 tbsp butter for 3 minutes, then place your steaks in the skillet and sear until browned on side. Flip the steak and sear the other side until browned.<em>Avoid moving steaks during searing process to ensure a crispy,brown crust.</em></li>
                <li>Immediately remove skillet from oven and add your seasonings and more butter to the pan.<em>Baste your steaks with a few spoonfuls of the melted butter before placing in the oven </em> </li>
                <li>Place your steaks in the oven for approxametly 3 minutes for a perfect, medium-rare filet mignon.<em>Cooking times will vary based upon meat weight and cooking preference</em> </li>
                <li>The last step is vital to a perfect steak. Let the steaks rest! Allow your steaks atleast 5 minutes to sit and cool on the plate before serving. This allows the meat to retain all the juices that are released when the steak is cut.</li>
                
            </ol></h6>
